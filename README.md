# sql-challenge

*In this project, we were given six CSV's that show data of employees for a fictional company, including those who are managers, their salaries, and their departments and titles. We were able to design our own ERD using QuickDBD by inspecting the CSV's, import the CSV's into a SQL database, and run queries on it. For the optional part of the project, we had to import SQL database into Pandas and do some visualizations.*

- ## Data
In data, we have the six CSV files, including departments, dept_emp, dept_manager, employees, salaries, and titles. 

- ## SQL Code 
In SQL Code, we have the schema code and query code.
<br>
To generate the schema code, we made primary keys in the departments, employee, and titles data. We then connected dept_emp, dept_manager, and salaries with foreign keys. The queries needed to be generated can be found in the query code. 

- ## PNGs
Here, the PNGs can be found for the QuickDBD export and the PNGs for the bonus part of the homework.
